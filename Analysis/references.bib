	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Within the network approach to psychopathology, cross-sectional partial correlation networks have frequently been used to estimate relationships between symptoms. The resulting relationships have been used to generate hypotheses about causal links between symptoms. In order to justify such exploratory use of partial correlation networks, one needs to assume that the between-subjects relationships in the network approximate systematic within-subjects relationships, which are in turn the results of some within-subjects causal mechanism. If this assumption holds, relationships in the network should be mirrored by relationships between symptom changes; if links in networks approximate systematic within-subject relationships, change in a symptom should relate to change in connected symptoms.
METHOD: To investigate this implication, we combined longitudinal data on the Borderline Personality Disorder Severity Index from four samples of borderline personality disorder patients (N = 683). We related parameters from baseline partial correlation networks of symptoms to relationships between change trajectories of these symptoms.
RESULTS: Across multiple levels of analysis, our results showed that parameters from baseline partial correlation networks are strongly predictive of relationships between change trajectories.
CONCLUSIONS: By confirming its implication, our results support the idea that cross-sectional partial correlation networks hold a relevant amount of information about systematic within-subjects relationships and thereby have exploratory value to generate hypotheses about the causal dynamics between symptoms.},

	abstract = {Both bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder (BPD) are serious mental health disorders resulting in significant psychosocial morbidity, reduced health-related quality of life, and excess mortality. Yet research on BPD has received much less funding from the National Institute of Health (NIH) than has bipolar disorder during the past 25 years. Why hasn't the level of NIH research funding for BPD been commensurate with the level of psychosocial morbidity, mortality, and health expenditures associated with the disorder? In the present article, the author illustrates how the bipolar disorder research community has done a superior job of "marketing" their disorder. Studies of underdiagnosis, screening, diagnostic spectra, and economics are reviewed for both bipolar disorder and BPD. Researchers of bipolar disorder have conducted multiple studies highlighting the problem with underdiagnosis, developed and promoted several screening scales, published numerous studies of the operating characteristics of these screening measures, attempted to broaden the definition of bipolar disorder by advancing the concept of the bipolar spectrum, and repeatedly demonstrated the economic costs and public health significance of bipolar disorder. In contrast, researchers of BPD have almost completely ignored each of these four issues and research efforts. Although BPD is as frequent as (if not more frequent than) bipolar disorder, as impairing as (if not more impairing than) bipolar disorder, and as lethal as (if not more lethal than) bipolar disorder, it has received less than one-tenth the level of funding from the NIH and has been the focus of many fewer publications in the most prestigious psychiatric journals. The researchers of BPD should consider adopting the strategy taken by researchers of bipolar disorder before the diagnosis is eliminated in a future iteration of the DSM or the ICD.},

METHODS: One hundred thirteen patients were included in the study. All subjects received intravitreal ranibizumab or bevacizumab injections. To measure the level of anxiety, Spielberg's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory questionnaire was used.
RESULTS: The mean state anxiety scores were 45.19 ± 5.62 in experienced patients and 43.10 ± 6.62 in inexperienced patients (p = 0.078). The mean trait anxiety scores were 50.14 ± 6.62 in experienced patients and 49.17 ± 10.79 in inexperienced patients (p = 0.810). Additionally, there was no statistically significant difference in the state and trait anxiety scores between the male and female, employed, and retired patients (p {\textgreater} 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Anxiety may not show significant differences according to sociodemographic status. High anxiety scores found in this study also emphasize that health care providers should try to decrease anxiety levels during the course of treatment.},

Eighty-two patients who reported having been previously diagnosed with bipolar disorder but who did not have it according to the SCID were compared to 528 patients who had never been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Patients with borderline personality disorder had significantly greater odds of a previous bipolar misdiagnosis, but no specific borderline criterion was unique in predicting this outcome.

Difficulty regulating emotions is a core feature of borderline personality disorder (BPD), one of the most common and impairing personality disorder diagnoses.

In a sample of online respondents (N = 471), we explored the interactions between anxiety symptoms and BPD traits in predicting well-being (WHO-5) as well as poorer work and social adjustment (WSAS), while controlling for anger and depression. We hypothesized that anxiety would lead to more impairment (i.e., lower well-being and poorer work and more difficulties with work and social adjustment) as BPD traits increased. BPD traits and symptoms of anxiety both contributed to overall lower levels well-being and higher levels of psychosocial dysfunction. However, contrary to our expectations, at higher (vs. lower) levels of BPD traits, symptoms of anxiety were less conducive to lower well-being on the WHO-5. For the WSAS, there was no consistent evidence for an interaction between BPD traits and anxiety in predicting functioning. By and large, our results do not support the idea that anxiety contributes to more impairment at higher levels of BPD traits.},

The current study aimed at examining the bidirectional longitudinal relationship between anxiety and paranoia, as well as the importance of worry and metacognitions in the development of these symptoms. Our validated sample consisted of 2291 participants recruited from universities, among whom 1746 participants (76.21\%) completed online questionnaires at baseline and at one year, reporting levels of anxiety, paranoia, worry, and negative metacognitions. Structural equation modeling analyses, followed by path comparisons, revealed that anxiety and paranoia mutually reinforced each other over time. Negative metacognitions, rather than worry itself, were contributive to the development of both symptoms over time. Negative metacognitions showed bi-directional relationships with anxiety over the time period assessed and showed uni-directional relationships with paranoia.

	abstract = {Background and objectives
Affective versus nonaffective psychoses are today no longer regarded as mutually exclusive disorders. Theorists have recently highlighted the role of affective symptoms in the formation of paranoid beliefs, particularly negative beliefs about the self, interpersonal sensitivity, sleep disturbances, and worrying, which exist along a continuum in the general population. For the present study, we tested the bidirectional causal relationships between paranoia and affect.
Method
A large population sample (N = 2,357) was examined at three time-points (baseline, six months, two years) as to the severity of subclinical paranoid beliefs (Paranoia Checklist, PCL) and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9, PHQ-9). Worrying and avoidance were measured with items from the Maladaptive and Adaptive Coping Style Questionnaire (MAX).
Results
Depression and paranoid symptoms were strongly cross-sectionally related (r = 0.69) and showed high stability (r {\textgreater} 0.72). Depressive symptoms at T2 predicted paranoid symptoms at T3 (beta = 0.16; no significant relationship from T1 to T2), whereas paranoid symptoms predicted depressive symptoms from T1 to T2 (beta = 0.09; no significant relationship from T2 to T3).
Limitations
Results should be replicated in a sample of paranoid patients, as risk factors for subclinical versus manifest paranoia may differ. Some constructs were measured with single items derived from a new scale.
Conclusions
The predictive association of depression to subsequent paranoia was small and confined to the long interval from T2 to T3. Treatments should target both paranoia and depression – irrespective of their causal relationship – particularly as patients with psychosis consider treatment of their emotional problems a priority.},

	abstract = {Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is often perceived to be a female-predominant disorder in both research and clinical contexts. Although there is growing recognition of possible sex differences, the current literature remains fragmented and inconclusive. This scoping review aimed to synthesize available research evidence on potential sex differences in BPD. PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus and Web-of-Science were searched from January 1982 to July 2022 surrounding the key concepts of sex and BPD. Data searching and screening processes followed the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology involving two independent reviewers, and a third reviewer if necessary, and identified 118 papers. Data regarding BPD symptoms, comorbid disorders, developmental factors, biological markers, and treatment were extracted. Data was summarized using the vote counting method or narrative synthesis depending on the availability of literature. Males with BPD were more likely to present externalizing symptoms (e.g., aggressiveness) and comorbid disorders (e.g., substance use), while females with BPD were more likely to present internalizing symptoms (e.g., affective instability) and comorbid disorders (e.g., mood and eating disorders). This review also revealed that substantially more research attention has been given to overall sex differences in baseline BPD symptoms and comorbid disorders. In contrast, there is a dearth of sex-related research pertaining to treatment outcomes, developmental factors, and possible biological markers of BPD. The present scoping review synthesized current studies on sex differences in BPD, with males more likely to present with externalizing symptoms in contrast to females. However, how this might change the prognosis of the disorder or lead to modifications of treatment has not been investigated. Most studies were conducted on western populations, mainly North American (55\%) or European (33\%), and there is a need for future research to also take into consideration genetic, cultural, and environmental concomitants. As the biological construct of ‘sex’ was employed in the present review, future research could also investigate the social construct ‘gender’. Longitudinal research designs are needed to understand any longer-term sex influence on the course of the disorder.},

Data were collected in two ways one from self declared user in social media(i.e. who declared themselves as Borderline Personality Disorder patients) and second by inviting people for a Borderline Personality Disorder screening test Permission has been taken to fetch their social media data for research. This research achieved an accuracy of 81.03\% using Random Forest classification algorithm. Emotional features were extracted from each data point in the dataset to identify the potential features for Borderline Personality Disorder classification. Features such as nervousness, shame, and pain have been derived that can in turn contribute to a similar accuracy to about 81.25\%. This attempt is to explain the heuristic explanation, how differently an individual with Borderline Personality Disorder reacts from other individuals. This research paves the way for identifying Borderline Personality Disorder among individuals.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Our theoretical model proposes that insomnia, worry, and negative affect are important determinants of paranoid thinking. Anxiety produces anticipation of threat, depression increases the sense of vulnerability, worry leads to implausible ideas, and insomnia exacerbates negative affect and creates an altered perceptual state. The study objective was to examine for the first time these factors as predictors of the onset of new paranoid thinking and of the persistence of existing paranoid thinking.
METHOD: A total of 2,382 participants in the 2000 British National Psychiatric Morbidity Survey were followed-up 18 months after their first assessment. Baseline assessments were used to predict the development and persistence of paranoid thinking at follow-up. Data were weighted to be representative of the general household population.
RESULTS: Insomnia, worry, anxiety, depression and depressive ideas were each substantial predictors both of new inceptions of paranoia and of the persistence of existing paranoid thinking. Worry and insomnia were the strongest predictors. For example, insomnia at the first assessment led to a more than threefold increase in later inceptions of paranoid thinking.
CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates that insomnia, worry, anxiety and depression are potential risk factors for new inceptions of paranoid thinking. The results also corroborate an emerging literature indicating that anxiety, worry and depression may encourage the persistence of paranoid thinking. The study provides the first longitudinal evidence linking insomnia and paranoia. The important clinical implication is that the use of interventions for common mental health difficulties in people with psychosis may have the additional benefit of reducing paranoia.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Because of the potential treatment implications, it is clinically important to distinguish between bipolar II depression and major depressive disorder with comorbid borderline personality disorder. The high frequency of diagnostic co-occurrence and resemblance of phenomenological features has led some authors to suggest that borderline personality disorder is part of the bipolar spectrum. Few studies have directly compared patients with bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder. In the present study from the Rhode Island Methods to Improve Diagnostic Assessment and Services project, we compared these 2 groups of patients on demographic, clinical, and family history variables.
METHOD: From December 1995 to May 2012, 3,600 psychiatric patients presenting to the outpatient practice at Rhode Island Hospital (Providence, Rhode Island) were evaluated with semistructured diagnostic interviews for DSM-IV Axis I and Axis II disorders. The focus of the present study is the 206 patients with DSM-IV major depressive disorder and borderline personality disorder (MDD-BPD) and 62 patients with DSM-IV bipolar II depression without borderline personality disorder.
RESULTS: The patients with MDD-BPD were significantly more often diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder (P {\textless} .001), a current substance use disorder (P {\textless} .01), somatoform disorder (P {\textless} .05), and other nonborderline personality disorder (P {\textless} .05). Clinical ratings of anger, anxiety, paranoid ideation, and somatization were significantly higher in the MDD-BPD group (all P {\textless} .01). The MDD-BPD patients were rated significantly lower on the Global Assessment of Functioning (P {\textless} .001), their current social functioning was poorer (P {\textless} .01), and they made significantly more suicide attempts (P {\textless} .01). The patients with bipolar II depression had a significantly higher morbid risk for bipolar disorder in their first-degree relatives than the MDD-BPD patients (P {\textless} .05).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients diagnosed with bipolar II depression and major depressive disorder with comorbid borderline personality disorder differed on a number of clinical and family history variables, thereby supporting the validity of this distinction.},

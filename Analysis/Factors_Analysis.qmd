```{python}
import math
import statistics
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import scipy.stats
#import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
#import seaborn as sns
```

```{python}
df = pd.read_csv(r"../Data/FactorsData/factors.csv")
```

# Descriptive Statistics
```{python}
summary_paranoia = df.groupby("run", as_index=False)["paranoiaM"].agg(["count","min","max","mean","std"])
print("Summary for paranoia\n",summary_paranoia)
print()
print()

summary_bdi = df.groupby("run", as_index=False)["bdiM"].agg(["count","min","max","mean","std"])
print("Summary for bdi\n",summary_bdi)
print()
print()

summary_stais = df.groupby("run", as_index=False)["staisM"].agg(["count","min","max","mean","std"])
print("Summary for stais\n",summary_stais)
print()
print()

summary_stait = df.groupby("run", as_index=False)["staitM"].agg(["count","min","max","mean","std"])
print("Summary for stais\n",summary_stait)
print()
print()
```

It seems like the data is the same regardless of the runs.

# Condition Checking

## Constant Variance

## Linearity

## Normality??
Normality is not a necessary condition for logistic regression, but we can still take a look.
